# NASA APOD

A dekstop application in Python connected with a NASA's API named [APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day).](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html)

Everyday is published an amazing photograph about the universe and our precious sky. This app connects directly with APOD and shows you his picture quickly without having to open the browser.

I recommend to use the app as a startup application: everyday when you turn on your computer you will start with the Astronomy Picture of the Day before your routine work.

Enjoy it!
